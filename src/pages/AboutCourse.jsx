        The “Quran School Online” Islamic Tarbiyah Classes is a comprehensive
        course designed to provide a deep understanding of Islamic teachings and
        their practical application in daily life. The course is intended to
        help students develop a strong relationship with Allah, purify their
        hearts, and cultivate good character and ethical behavior. Tarbiyah,
        which means nurturing or education, is an essential component of Islamic
        teachings. It involves the development of one’s spiritual, moral, and
        intellectual capacities through a disciplined and structured approach.
        The “Quran School Online” emphasizes the importance of Tarbiyah in
        personal and collective development and considers it an integral part of
        Islamic education. The course is structured in a way that provides a
        step-by-step approach to Tarbiyah, starting with the purification of the
        heart and character development, followed by the exploration of Islamic
        ethics and morality, prayer and worship, Islamic history and heritage,
        and relationship with Allah and His Messenger. The course also
        emphasizes the practical application of Tarbiyah in daily life and its
        relevance in contemporary times.
